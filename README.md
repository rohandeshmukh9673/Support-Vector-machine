# Support-Vector-machine
Implementation of support vector machine (linear kernel) with accuracy of 83.5%.
Result is shown in figure: classification using SVM.
Linear kernel is used for classification.
318 datapoints has been used. Out of which 190 are for training and 128 are for testing.
Further improvements can be done in terms of gaussian kernel or any non linear kernel.
